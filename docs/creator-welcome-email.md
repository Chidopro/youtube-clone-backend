Hi,

Welcome to ScreenMerch — we're glad you're here.

You get your own store link (yourname.screenmerch.com) where only your videos show. In Personalization you can add your logo, colors, and a custom title and description so your store feels like you.

We invite you to sign in and check out the products we offer — from women's and men's to kids, mugs, bags, hats, and more (stickers, magnets, greeting cards, and more). You'll see prices and colors for each item so you know exactly what your fans can order.

Fans pick a moment from your video, capture a screenshot, and put it on any product. Every screenshot is processed for 300 DPI print quality. You earn $7 per sale on most items; we handle printing and shipping.

**Next steps:** Sign in, browse the catalog, set your subdomain, upload your videos, and share your link.

*(Replace with your actual sign-in URL, e.g. https://screenmerch.com/login)*

Thanks for joining — we're excited to have you.

## Body (HTML-style for rich email)

If your tool supports simple HTML, you can use:

- **Bold** for “Sign in and explore products” and “Next steps”
- One prominent button or link for “Sign in and explore products” (primary CTA)
- A secondary text link for “Watch our intro video”
- Short paragraphs as above (2–3 sentences each) so it stays scannable

Keep one primary CTA: **Sign in and explore products**.
