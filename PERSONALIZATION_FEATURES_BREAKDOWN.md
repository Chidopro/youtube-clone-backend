## 🔄 **How It Works Technically**

### **Same Code, Different Data:**

```javascript
// When visitor goes to john.screenmerch.com:

1. App loads (same JavaScript for everyone)
2. Detects subdomain: "john"
3. Queries database: "Get creator with subdomain='john'"
4. Filters content: "Show only videos where user_id = john's_id"
5. Applies branding: "Use john's colors and logo"
6. Renders pages: "All pages available, just filtered content"
```

### **All Routes Work:**

```
john.screenmerch.com/                    → Home (John's videos)
john.screenmerch.com/video/123/456       → Video player (if John's video)
john.screenmerch.com/products            → All products (available)
john.screenmerch.com/tools               → All tools (available)
john.screenmerch.com/upload              → Upload (John can upload)
john.screenmerch.com/dashboard           → Dashboard (John's data)
john.screenmerch.com/checkout            → Checkout (works same)
... (all routes work)
```
